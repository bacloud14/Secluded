### Contributing to Secluded

Like my other repositories, I try to make my projects welcoming to new comers. Whether you are new to open source or to programming in general, this is a nice starter project.

Todo:

A lot of things, basically only URL generation is done at this stage.

Dataset generation logic was done too.

But, No statistics logic was written. The website will definitly serve datasets of crawlers visits but a dashboard of statistic if welcome.

Please see open issues for a specific issue, and do not hesitate to open any new issue (like better code, readability, modularity and best practice, performance, better UI or even functionality enhancements...).

Please know that I am not a keen NodeJS developer, but I successfully made this web application. It is in its early stage and not proper for final service yet.

If you contribute, please consider that I can merge and publish a new release under one channel or another. It will be 100% free although I can add ads to generate some coffee expenses :)

If you want to maintain the project with me; You can alwayse ask.

Please keep it fair if you want to deploy anywhere; Ask for permission.

Sweet coding !
